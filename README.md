# 🛰️ Hi, I'm Alessandro

### Spacecraft Operations Engineer

Space & Astronautics MSc graduate and Mission Operations Engineer with a background in ESA’s Moonlight initiative. I specialize in Orbit Determination and high-fidelity dynamics. Currently expanding my technical stack into Rust for safety-critical flight software and Java/Orekit for mission analysis, while mastering Advanced Spacecraft Dynamics via the Schaub framework.

## 🚀 Key Projects & Research

### 🌑 [Lunar Orbit Determination] (https://github.com/Detumbled/Detumbled/releases/download/Update/MsC_thesis_Debellis_Moonlight.pdf)
*Derived from my MSc Thesis at Sapienza University of Rome*
* Developed innovative navigation solutions for the **Moonlight** program, achieving **cm-level Orbit Determination (OD)**.
* Leveraged **ESA’s GODOT** framework for high-fidelity lunar orbit estimation and multi-satellite ranging.
* **Key Focus:** Lunar GNSS applications, non-linear estimation, and complex gravitational perturbations.

### 📐 [Dynamics-Rosetta]
*Future project*
* A comparative study of orbital propagators implemented in **C++, Rust, and Java**.
* Benchmarking numerical precision vs. execution speed to evaluate memory-safe languages for future GNC applications.

### 🎡 [Dynamics & AOCS Toolkit]
*In Progress*
* A comprehensive **C++ library** for spacecraft attitude dynamics and control via **Momentum Exchange Devices** (RWs/CMGs/VSCMGs).
* Implementing kinematics ($MRPs$, Quaternions) and control laws to be integrated into a large-scale mission simulator.

### 🛠️ [Ops-Workflow-Enhancer]
* A Python-based automation suite designed to streamline **Mission Operations** workflows.
* Automates **Procedure Writing & Validation**, Database (DB) integrity checking, and automated spreadsheet report generation.
* Significant reduction in manual overhead and human-error margins for the flight operations team.
